   need to consider two things:
   1. executor for main loop (hook into camerax API)
      a. consider abstracting the `analyze` method of the camera
      b. pass the analyze method into some class to use as an executor
      c. generalize this out to part 2

   2. Create a looper which will execute an `analyze` method given an executor and an analyze method
      a. should be able to specify our own "analyzer"
